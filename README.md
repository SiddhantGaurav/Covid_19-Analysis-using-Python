ðŸ‘‰COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the Corona Virus, biologically known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease was first identified in Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province in December 2019 and has spread all over the world since then. As of writing this, on 26th April 2020, 21:57 IST, there are 2.92 million confirmed cases throughout the world and has resulted in 204,000 deaths according to Google.

In this notebook, I will take a look at the current situation in India. We will take a look at the regions which are most hampered by the outbreak and how numbers have steadily climbed in the country

To start off, we will import the necessary libraries which I will be using in my analysis and the different data tables from where I sourced my information.
